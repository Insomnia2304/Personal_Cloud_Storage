Personal Cloud Storage is a simple and fast tool to store your data in a secure cloud
system. It provides its users with a login system which connects them via a unique username and
a password. Once signed up and logged in, users can upload their files (or even folders) directly
into the cloud. Similarly, they can list and download their data anywhere and anytime.
The software provides a user-friendly interface which helps people see their saved files and
maneuver them as fast as possible. An advantage of storing your data in the cloud is that now
you have access to it among all your devices that support the application. Privacy for your data
is guaranteed since everything saved within the cloud is encrypted with a Vigen√®re key, a powerful
and hard to crack encrypting method. The application also has redundancy implemented to protect
the stored information at all costs.
